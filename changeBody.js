// Copy some HTML that you need to paste
// Open blank browser page if you are lazy to save the file, open code editor, start a dev server, if you just want to see what is in html and how it looks. 
// Create a var with copied html

const body = `PASTE YOUR HTML HERE (Watch for some characters that could potentially end the backtick template literal)`
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].outerHTML = body;

Voila, take a look at that beatiful html.
